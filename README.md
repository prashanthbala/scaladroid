==========

Testing out Android programming with Scala using the plugin

- Created a Future-based asyncronous Http client Trait
- Created a Relection based Logging Trait that is useful for debugging the Scala way and changes to logic of logging can be refactored later
- Created grid view with custom pictures
- Created a toast notification with that fetches a message from the server
- Created a progress bar wrapper that is used while waiting for the result of a Future
